# Python Jour 2 - Les Boucles

Training project for learning Python loops (`for` and `while` statements).

## Overview

This project contains 9 programming exercises focusing on loop structures and control flow in Python. The exercises progress from simple iteration to more complex loop patterns.

## Exercises (Jobs)

### Job 01: Display Numbers 0-20
Display all integers from 0 to 20 using a `for` loop.

### Job 02: Display Every Other Number 0-20
Display every second number from 0 to 20 using a `for` loop with step.

### Job 03: Display Squares
Display numbers from 1 to 20 and their squares (n²).

### Job 04: Multiplication Tables
Display multiplication tables from 1 to N, where N is user-provided input.

### Job 05: Convert For Loop to While
Convert the Job 01 logic (0 to 12) from a `for` loop to a `while` loop.

### Job 06: Multiplication by 7
Use a `while` loop to display multiplication results of user-input number N by 7 (first 10 results).

### Job 07: Loop with Expression
Execute a loop 12 times and display: (iteration × 3) - 2

### Job 08: Loop with Addition
Execute a loop 12 times and display: iteration + 2

### Job 09: Even and Odd Numbers
Display all numbers from 1 to 30, labeling each as "Pair" (even) or "Impair" (odd).

## Usage

```bash
python projet\ jour\ 2.py
```

Or run directly:

```bash
python "projet jour 2.py"
```

**Note:** Jobs 04 and 06 require user input during execution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies

## Structure

## Key Learning Outcomes

- ✅ Understanding `for` loops with ranges and steps
- ✅ Understanding `while` loops and loop control
- ✅ Nested loops (multiplication tables)
- ✅ String formatting with f-strings
- ✅ Conditional logic within loops (even/odd detection)
- ✅ User input handling with `input()` and type conversion

## Notes

- All exercises use French variable names and output strings to match the course material
- The PDF document (`Python Jour 2 - Les Boucles.pdf`) contains the original course content and requirements
- Each job is clearly commented in the source code
